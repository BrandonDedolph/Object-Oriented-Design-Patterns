Object-oriented design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They provide templates for structuring code to improve readability, scalability, and maintainability. Common categories include:

Creational: Focus on object creation (e.g., Singleton, Factory).
Structural: Define object composition (e.g., Adapter, Decorator).
Behavioral: Focus on object interactions (e.g., Observer, Strategy).
